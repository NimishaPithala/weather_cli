# weather_cli
this is a self help project for me to put my C++ skills and working style of APIs.
I am plannign to make this a little AI driven product. I will soon integrate it with AI powered recommnedation system adn integrate AI cloud services.
The final step will be to try and execute this as a website (adding frontend and backend to it)

The current status of the project is that it is connected to a weather API and gives real time updates according to the user selected city/location. I added a rule based system where the user is given diferent options, accoridngly the cli responds to the user with recommendations. (This is where I would like to enhance using AI)
